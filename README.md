# MPLAB Arduino Import plugin
> A wizard that allows importing Arduino projects
This plugin contains an import wizard that can be launched from File->Import->Import Arduino Project.
The wizard will allow you to select a sketch file (*.ino) that was created in Arduino IDE.
Next, it will convert the sketch into an MPLAB X Makefile project.
With this project you will be able to build and debug the Arduino sketch in MPLAB X.

A complete set of Help documentation is included.
Note that the wizard can import a project in two ways:
1) Copying all source code and libraries, in order to create a stand-alone MPLAB X project which is logically separate from the original (default mode) or
2) Retaining links to external source code and libraries that exist in the Arduino environment.

The Arduino Import Plugin requires the following software to be installed:
- MPLAB X v4.10 or later
- Arduino IDE v1.81 or later
- Relevant toolchains configured in MPLAB X
## Installing / Getting started

A quick introduction of the minimal setup you need to get a hello world up &
running.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.
